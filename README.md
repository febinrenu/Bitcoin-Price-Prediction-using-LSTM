# Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the price of Bitcoin using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting tasks due to its ability to learn long-term dependencies. The project involves data preprocessing, building an LSTM model, training the model on historical Bitcoin price data, and evaluating its performance.

## Features

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Building and training the LSTM model
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing predictions vs actual prices

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/febinrenu/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM.git
cd Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
```
## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook

Navigate to and open Bitcoin_Price_Prediction.ipynb.

Run the cells sequentially to:

- Explore and preprocess the data
- Build and train the LSTM model
- Evaluate the model and visualize the results
